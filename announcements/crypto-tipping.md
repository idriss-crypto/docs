# Crypto Tipping

## Crypto Payments. The New Chapter for IDriss Begins.

**TL;DR IDriss expands beyond the address book. Today we are releasing the first tool from our crypto payments vertical: a shortcut for online creators to get paid in crypto on Twitter and soon on other platforms.**

Most traditional financial providers charge high fees for moving our money. But, what if a portion of these fees could go back to us in some way? What if we could decide on how these fees are spent?

With the new set of web3 rails, we can make it happen and build decentralized, community-owned and operated crypto payment processing tools. Fees generated through these tools will go back to our community and will be spent on product improvements and growth.

Today we are releasing the first tool from our crypto payments vertical: a shortcut for online creators to get paid in crypto on Twitter.

Users can seamlessly send native tokens and stablecoins over Polygon, Ethereum, and BSC networks. Adding support for more tokens and networks is planned for the near future. 1% of each transaction supplies IDriss treasury.

The future is optimistic. We are working on enabling this solution to online creators on other platforms: Twitch, YouTube, and others. Stay tuned.

Do you want to help make it happen? We are hiring core contributors (dev & growth) as well as looking for community members who can contribute in all sort of ways.
