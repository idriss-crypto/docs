# Payments on Twitter

IDriss expands beyond the address book. We released the first tool from our crypto payments vertical: a shortcut for online creators to get tipped in crypto on Twitter, and soon on other platforms.&#x20;

Users can seamlessly send native tokens and stablecoins over Polygon, Ethereum, and BSC networks. Adding support for more tokens and networks is planned for the near future. 1% of each transaction supplies IDriss' treasury.

The future is optimistic. We are working on enabling this solution for online creators on additional platforms: Twitch, YouTube, and others.

Using the IDriss [browser extension](broken-reference), you can see the IDriss icon <img src="../../.gitbook/assets/icon128.png" alt="" data-size="line"> next to registered usernames on Twitter. You can then hover over the symbol to select your preferred amount, network, and token or coin. View the complete demo below.

In the future, this functionality will be available across several platforms! Stay tuned.

**Good to know:** To tip your favorite creator with IDriss, you don't need to be registered in the address book. All you need is our browser extension and some tokens to give away.
