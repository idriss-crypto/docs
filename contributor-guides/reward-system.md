# Reward System

IDriss is a community-owned and operated project. We developed a system which lets the community earn reward points. The goal of this system is to accelerate the growth of IDriss by attracting more users and contributors.

### **General Rules**

1. To participate in the reward system, you must first register your IDriss [here](https://www.idriss.xyz/).
2. Rewards for Twitter activity is available only to users who register their Twitter.
3. Rewards for Discord invites are available after posting your IDriss in the #drop-your-idriss channel in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/RJhJKamjw5) server. Only invite links without expiration are taken into account.
4. Final rewards will be claimable to the owner address of your IDriss.
5. There are currently no reward limits per user. This may be subject to change if users find ways to exploit or abuse the system.
6. Make sure that you own your IDriss and [change ownership](https://www.idriss.xyz/dashboard) to the correct address if needed.
7. Updates to reward rates or other changes will be posted on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RJhJKamjw5).
8. Head over to the [Dashboard](https://www.idriss.xyz/dashboard) to manage your IDriss, view your reward points, and add tweets to your reward list.

### Reward Rates

Currently, reward points can be collected through four different activities: tweeting, Discord invites, IDriss referrals, and registrations. See [Rates](reward-system.md#rates) for details.

**Twitter**\
\
Note: Twitter points are currently on hold due to changes to the Twitter API.

Create content about IDriss on Twitter to get reward points. When you tweet, make sure to tag @IDriss\_xyz and #IDriss. Interactions on your tweets increase your total point score. An interaction is defined as any like or retweet. Reward points are attributed to the owner address of your IDriss.

**Discord**

Get reward points by inviting people to our [Discord](https://discord.gg/RJhJKamjw5). Share your registered IDriss in the #drop-your-idriss channel in our Discord, so we can match your invites to your account. Make sure to use an invite link without expiration so that your invite count doesn't reset.

Users abusing this system by inviting bots, fake accounts, re-inviting the same account over and over again, or following other dishonest measures will be excluded from the rewards system.

**Referrals**

Invite others to IDriss to increase your score. Every successful sign-up via your referral link rewards you with points.

**IDriss Ownership**

Register IDriss for yourself and get reward points for each registration.
