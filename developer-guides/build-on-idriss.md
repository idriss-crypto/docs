# Build on IDriss

We provide a node.js and webpack library that allows you to easily integrate IDriss into your project. However, if you prefer to create your own resolver, you have that option as well.

Find our open-source library on [GitHub](https://github.com/idriss-crypto/ts-library) or explore it below.
